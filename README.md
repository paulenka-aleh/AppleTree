AppleTree
=========

Model of an apple tree on which apples are grow. You can shake it to make it drop apples down.

Capacity of flowers and apples is limited for 5000
Apples are grow only from flowers.
Extended methods allow to shake tree for some seconds and wait for some time while flowers and apples are grow.

How to use:
 - blossom [times]:
       Wait till random number of flowers blossom. Optionally repeat command n times. Displays number of flowers blossomed.
 - grow [times]
       Wait till random number of apples grow. Optionally repeat command n times. Displays number of apples grown.
 - shake [times]
       Shake the tree, so some apples may fall down. Optionally repeat command n times. Displays number of apples fallen.
 - exit:
       Terminates the program.

During solving this task I learned how to:
 - Set up Git on Windows and set up connection via SSH or HTTPS.
 - Create and clone a Git repository.
 - Make commits to the local repository.
 - Push and pull changes.
 - Create branches for features and remove them.
 - Share feature branches or preserve it in the local repository.
 - Switch between branches.
 - Make fast-forward merges.
 - Make non-fast-forward merges and resolve conflicts.
 - Stash changes when commit isn't ready but you urgently need to switch to another branch (e.g. for fixing critical bug).
 - Using EGit integration pluging for Eclipse IDE.
